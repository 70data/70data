```
Warning: phpinfo() [function.phpinfo]: It is not safe to rely on the system's timezone settings. You are *required* to use the date.timezone setting or the date_default_timezone_set() function. In case you used any of those methods and you are still getting this warning, you most likely misspelled the timezone identifier. We selected 'UTC' for '8.0/no DST' instead in D:\apache2.2\htdocs\index.php on line 2
```

## 解决思路

修改 `php.ini`, 加上

```
date.timezone = "Asia/Shanghai"
```
