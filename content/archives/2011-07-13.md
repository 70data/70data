基础方法

```
ids = [1,2,3,3,4,2,3,4,5,6,1]
news_ids = []
for id in ids:
    if id not in news_ids:
        news_ids.append(id)
print news_ids
```

<!--more-->

set 容器

```
ids = [1,4,3,3,4,2,3,4,5,6,1]
news_ids = list(set(ids))
news_ids.sort(ids.index)
```

itertools.grouby

```
ids = [1,4,3,3,4,2,3,4,5,6,1]
ids.sort()
it = itertools.groupby(ids)
for k, g in it:
    print k
```

reduce

```
ids = [1,4,3,3,4,2,3,4,5,6,1]
func = lambda x,y:x if y in x else x + [y]
reduce(func, [[], ] + ids)
[1, 4, 3, 2, 5, 6]
```
